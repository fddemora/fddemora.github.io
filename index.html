                Hi, my name is Fellipe and welcome to my portfolio. <br><br>
                I'm a program analyst at Cognizant Technical Solutions. <br><br>
                The goal is to just showcase my technical skills and I plan to do this
                by putting my code in Github and also use a free host provider to put it into
                the internet. <br><br>
                Since my professional background revolves around Salesforce, I'll focus on using Javascript (ES6), Lightning Web Components (LWC), etc..., to show my work. 
                This portfolio being the exception.<br><br>
                Thanks for visiting!
            </p>
